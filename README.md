This is my 5th project for my Software Engineering Bootcamp.
It uses OOP to manage stock in a shoe warehouse. A .txt file stores the following information for each shoe:
● Country
● Code
● Product
● Cost
● Quantity
● Value

After creating a Shoe class, the program reads the .txt file into a list and writes functions to allow the user to:
● View all shoe data.
● Input new shoe stock
● Search products by code.
● Find the total stock value of each shoe product.
● Determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it.
● Determine the product with the highest quantity and put it on sale.
● Calculate the total value of each stock item. The total value is calculated by
multiplying the cost by the quantity for each item entered into the system.
